I'm a cosmologist who spends most of my time ~~being confused~~ thinking about how to robustly analyze large-scale structure data to better inform physical models of our universe's history. 
I'm a Porat Fellow at Stanford University <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">(KIPAC)</a> and hold a joint appointment as a Stephen Hawking Advanced Fellow / Senior Research Associate at the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">(DAMTP)</a>.

Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">UC Berkeley</a> where I was a member of the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics</a> and a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">DOE SCGSR</a> awardee hosted at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. 
I was advised by <a href="https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Martin White</a> and <a href="https://sferraro.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Simone Ferraro</a>.
Before moving to the best coast I studied physics and math at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Cornell University</a>, where I worked under <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Michael Niemack</a> and <a href="https://evevavagiakis.com/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Eve Vavagiakis</a> as an undergraduate research assistant. 
During the summer of 2018 I had a brief stint as a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">DOE SULI</a> intern at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/hirohisa-tanaka" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Hirohisa Tanaka</a>. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing in the ocean, lounging with <a href="#" class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-mrmay">Mr. May</a>, <a href="#" class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-backpacking">backpacking</a>, consuming music of all form(at)s, and scouring the streets of San Francisco for the perfect <a href="#" class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-sammy">breakfast sandwich</a>.
