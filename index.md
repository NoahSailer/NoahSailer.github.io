I'm a cosmologist who spends most of my time ~~being confused~~ analyzing large-scale structure data to better inform physical models of our universe's history. I'm currently based at Stanford/SLAC <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">(KIPAC)</a> as a Porat Fellow. I have a joint appointment at Cambridge <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">(DAMTP)</a> as a Senior Research Associate / Stephen Hawking Advanced Fellow, and plan to hop the pond in 2027. 

I was previously a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Martin White</a> and <a href="https://sferraro.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Simone Ferraro</a>. I spent most of my time at the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">BCCP</a> and one year as a DOE <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">SCGSR</a> Fellow at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">LBNL</a>.
Before moving to the best coast, I studied physics and math at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Cornell University</a>. During that time I experimented with being an experimentalist in <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Michael Niemack</a>'s group, where I was primarily advised by <a href="https://evevavagiakis.com/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">Eve Vavagiakis</a>.

I grew up in western Virginia with zero interest in physics or astronomy[^1] until my senior year of high school, when I took my first physics class. 
In my free time I enjoy playing in the ocean, lounging with <a class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-mrmay">Mr. May</a>, 
<a class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-backpacking">backpacking</a>, consuming music of all form(at)s, 
and scouring the streets of San Francisco for the perfect <a class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-sammy">breakfast sandwich</a>.

[^1]:but plenty of interest in dirt bikes and <a class="popup-trigger" data-target="modal-harry">reptiles</a>
