I'm a physics Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">UC Berkeley</a> where I'm advised by <a href="https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Martin White</a> and <a href="https://sferraro.lbl.gov/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Simone Ferraro</a>. 
I'm a member of the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics</a> and was previously a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">DOE SCGSR</a> fellow hosted at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Before moving to the best coast I completed my bachelor's in physics and mathematics at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Cornell University</a> in 2019, where I worked under <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Michael Niemack</a> and <a href="https://evevavagiakis.com/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Eve Vavagiakis</a> as an undergraduate research assistant. 
During the summer of 2018 I had a brief stint as a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">DOE SULI</a> intern at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/hirohisa-tanaka" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline">Hirohisa Tanaka</a>.
