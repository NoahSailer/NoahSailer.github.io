Hi! I'm Noah Sailer, a physics Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">UC Berkeley</a> where I'm advised by <a href="https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Martin White</a> and <a href="https://sferraro.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Simone Ferraro</a>. I'm a cosmologist who spends most of my time ~~being confused~~ thinking about how to robustly analyze large-scale structure data (CMB, galaxies, 21cm line, etc.) to better inform physical models of our universe's history. 

I'm a member of the <a href="https://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics</a> and was previously a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">DOE SCGSR</a> fellow hosted at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Before moving to the best coast I completed my bachelor's in physics and mathematics at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Cornell University</a> in 2019, where I worked under <a href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~mdn49/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Michael Niemack</a> and <a href="https://evevavagiakis.com/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Eve Vavagiakis</a> as an undergraduate research assistant. 
During the summer of 2018 I had a brief stint as a <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">DOE SULI</a> intern at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/hirohisa-tanaka" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: ">Hirohisa Tanaka</a>.
