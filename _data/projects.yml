- title: Where's the matter?
  image: /assets/images/profile_bias.png
  description: >
     The impact of non-gravitational physics on the "small-scale" (a little larger than a galaxy) matter distribution is 
     a key source of systematic uncertainty when extracting cosmological information from high-resolution surveys. These 
     works explore data-driven approaches to better understand the highly-energetic processes responsible for the 
     redistribution of matter within and around galaxies.

  description: >
     Recent measurements from <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">DESI</a> 
     show mild (2.2σ) tension with CMB data when analyzed assuming our "standard model of cosmology" (ΛCDM), suggesting 
     a ≃3σ preference for evolving dark energy. The significance of this preference is sensitive to the optical depth to 
     reionization (τ) and can alternatively be phrased as a ≃3-5σ "τ tension."

     We jointly analyze CMB lensing and

     The <a href="https://spec-s5.org/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none"> "Stage-5" spectroscopic experiment</a> 
     is a proposed successor to <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" style="color: #cbe0f5; text-decoration: none">DESI</a>
