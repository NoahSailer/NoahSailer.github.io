  description: >
     Recent BAO measurements from DESI show mild (2.2σ) tension with CMB data when analyzed assuming our "standard model 
     of cosmology" (ΛCDM), suggesting a ≃3σ preference for "new physics" (e.g. evolving dark energy or the sum of the 
     neutrino masses being smaller than the neutrino oscillation lower bound). The significance of this preference 
     is sensitive to the optical depth to reionization (τ) and can alternatively be phrased as a ≃3-5σ "τ tension."

     The <a href="https://spec-s5.org/" style="color: white; text-decoration: wavy underline gray"> "Stage-5" spectroscopic experiment</a> 
     is a proposed successor to <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" style="color: white; text-decoration: wavy underline gray">DESI</a>
     that would signficantly improve our understanding of the early universe through measuring spectra of high-redshift galaxies.
     I've played a significant role in developing the science case for a Stage-5 survey.
